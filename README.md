# RTGPProject
To build the project just unzip the libs.rar file in the libs folder and open the Progetto.code-workspace in Visual Studio. After that, run the task for the build. If you have any problem check in the .vscode folder the paths in those files or download the correct libs for 
 your system. The build will be in the build folder.
